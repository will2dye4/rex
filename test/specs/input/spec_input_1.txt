The Battle of Gettysburg was fought July 1-3, 1863, in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.
It was the battle with the largest number of casualties in the American Civil War and is often described as
the war's turning point. Union Maj. Gen. George Gordon Meade's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, ending Lee's invasion of the North.

After his success at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863, Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley
to begin his second invasion of the North-the Gettysburg Campaign. With his army in high spirits, Lee intended
to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern
politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, or even
Philadelphia. Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit, but was
relieved just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade.

Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, as Lee urgently concentrated his
forces there, his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it. Low ridges to the northwest of town
were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig. Gen. John Buford, and soon reinforced with two
corps of Union infantry. However, two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north,
collapsing the hastily developed Union lines, sending the defenders retreating through the streets of town
to the hills just to the south.

On the second day of battle, most of both armies had assembled. The Union line was laid out in a defensive
formation resembling a fishhook. In the late afternoon of July 2, Lee launched a heavy assault on the Union
left flank, and fierce fighting raged at Little Round Top, the Wheatfield, Devil's Den, and the Peach Orchard.
On the Union right, demonstrations escalated into full-scale assaults on Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill.
All across the battlefield, despite significant losses, the Union defenders held their lines.

On the third day of battle, July 3, fighting resumed on Culp's Hill, and cavalry battles raged to the east and
south, but the main event was a dramatic infantry assault by 12,500 Confederates against the center of the Union
line on Cemetery Ridge, known as Pickett's Charge. The charge was repulsed by Union rifle and artillery fire,
at great losses to the Confederate army. Lee led his army on a torturous retreat back to Virginia. Between
46,000 and 51,000 soldiers from both armies were casualties in the three-day battle. That November, President
Lincoln used the dedication ceremony for the Gettysburg National Cemetery to honor the fallen Union soldiers
and redefine the purpose of the war in his historic Gettysburg Address.
